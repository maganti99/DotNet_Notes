MVC Projects things learnt :
- Custom Model binders can be created by creating a class which implements IModelBinder interface and registring this class via ModelBinders.Binders method (add to ModelBinderDictionary)
   in Global.asax.
  These modelbinders will be executed for every post request. 
- When an object of class (having a collection), is placed in Session variable and new values added to the collection of the object after, Session variable will gets these updates




Base and Derived classes
========================

- When Class (Derived) inherits from base class
   - when object is made of derived class, base class constuctor is executed first followed by derived class constructor
   - if base class has multiple constructors, derived class can choose which constructor needs to be executed by using base keyword on derived class constructor
     public FullTime_Employee() : base("Nagesh")
            {
                
                Console.WriteLine("Derived Class Constructor");
            }
   - A base class method can be invoked from derived class methode using base.method_name()
         public void Test()
            {
                base.Print("From Test");
             
            }
    - An object reference of base class can pe pointed to object of dervived class
           baseClass bc = new derivedClass()
      In this case, baseClass refrence (bc) can access all members (properties, methods) of base class only, althoug the object (derived class) may have more members 
      In order for baseClass refrence (bc) to access all the members of derived class, it needs to be type casted to derived class. 
                ((derivedClass)bc).new_method()


Order of execution of methods depending on the attributes used.
For web applications we can have specific methods of class to get executed before Application_Start runs using attributes

- System.Web.PreApplicationStartMethodAttribute
- WebActivatorEx.PreApplicationStartMethodAttribute
  Ex: [assembly: WebActivatorEx.PreApplicationStartMethod(typeof(OnlineShoppingStore.WebUI.App_Start.NinjectWebCommon), "Start")]
- Global.asax (Application_Start method)
- OwinStartupAttribute


Types of dependency injections :
==============================
- Construtor injection
- Method Injection
- Property injection


Frameworks
- Unity Framework
